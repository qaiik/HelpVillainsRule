        Recently, villainsrule changed his name to DepressedVillain, and said he was very sad.
        
        He said that there was things going on in his life that made him very sad. 
        He decided to just keep what happened to himself.
        
        No one deserves to feel this sad, so I knew I had to do something to make him feel happier. 
        I decided that this website would be the perfect thing.
